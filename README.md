# mathsCourse6thClass
Maths course for kids like my daughter, who got to skip a year ahead in maths, but run out of school books for their last year of primary school. The overlap with the normal curriculum is kept at a minimum, because maths is so much more than that, and to avoid boredom further down the line.

At the moment, there is already a part about alternative numbering systems. I covered Roman numerals, binary, hexadecimal and octal numbers. 

The next part is all about integers. Working with negative numbers and powers (briefly), easy ways to check divisibility by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11 etc, prime factor decomposition with the accompanying highest common factor and lowest common multiple, ratio, proportionality and some riddles.

I do my best to check all exercises and spellings and make it as perfect as I can. But I am just one person making this, so please don't expect actual perfection.

Over the next couple of months, more will be added in order to create a course that can be used for an entire school year. I have started on modular arithmetic, I hope to cover set theory and logic later on as well.
