# mathsCourse6thClass
Maths course for kids like my daughter, who got to skip a year ahead in maths, but run out of school books for their last year of primary school. These maths topics are not included in the normal curriculum, because maths is so much more than that, and to avoid boredom further down the line.

At the moment, I have written about alternative numbering systems. I covered Roman numerals, binary, hexadecimal and octal numbers. I did my best to check all exercises and spellings and make it as perfect as I can. But I am just one person making this, so don't expect actual perfection.
Over the next couple of months, more will be added in order to create a course that can be used for an entire school year. On my wish list of topics to cover are set theory, logic, modular arithmetic and more.
